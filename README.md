# Employee Promotion Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This repository presents the analysis and prediction of employee promotions using logistic regression and XGBoost algorithms. The goal is to explore and compare the performance of these two models in predicting which employees are likely to be promoted based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is included in the 'data' directory. It contains relevant features such as employee performance metrics, tenure, education level, and more. The dataset is named `Employees Promotion.csv`.

## Jupyter Notebook

The main analysis and modeling work can be found in the Jupyter Notebook named `employees_promotion_DA.ipynb`. Here's a brief overview of the steps covered:

1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the structure, features, and distributions within the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing key relationships and patterns in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building:** Implementing logistic regression and XGBoost models for predicting employee promotions.
6. **Model Comparison:** Evaluating and comparing the performance of logistic regression and XGBoost using relevant metrics.
7. **Conclusion:** Summarizing findings and insights from the analysis.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results
The results of the model comparison, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are detailed in the notebook. Check the conclusion section for insights on which model performed better for this specific employee promotion prediction task.
